/*!
	Sound Engine (Manager)

	Allows for low-latency, simultaneous playback of  1 BGM 
 	and several Sound Effects. Wraps Apple's Audio Unit directly for 
	maximum performance.
 	
 @note
	Internally, the engine consists of a number of independent 'buses', each 
	of which is able of loading one sound from file and playing it back.
	One of the buses is dedicated to lengthy sounds and is referred to as "BGM".
	This is because the iPhone hardware can decompress one sound stream at any 
	given moment, so this bus is the only one that can play compressed files 
	such as mp3. The rest (dubbed 'effect buses') are meant to play short sounds
	and only support audio in the uncompressed, .caf format.
